This is a widget that allows you to quickly and easily create a flttr widget within posts and pages using a simple shortcode. The advantage of having a shortcode is that it can be customised for every use. The short code has lots of customisability and can be used in a very basic way or with more advanced features.

The way the widget works is that within a post or page you include the shortcode and then that shortcode will generate all the javascript needed to embed the widget. That means you don't need any knowledge of coding or js. As opposed to the official Flattr Widget, you do not need to embed a php function to get the widget or have it included in every post. You can call the shortcode from within a post or page and the most important thing is that you have the option to customise the widget every time! This does not mean that the official Flattr Widget does not have its place, and I actually recommend using both in conjunction!

This means that you can insert widgets that will Flattr pages other than the one you are on (for example some external content) and it will also allow you to set the Flattr User ID per widget meaning you can have multiple widgets for multiple people, or allow blogs that have multiple authors to add a Flattr widget that will flattr them (rather than the site) for their content.
